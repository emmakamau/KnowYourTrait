## Description

KnowYourTrait is a web application that allows users to take a personality test whose result at the end will inform the user of their :

- personality trait
- a brief description of what it means to be an individual of that temperament
- career paths that would best suit them being an individual of that temperament.

The application consists of the home, about, contact and the quiz section. The quizes are fun , attention capturing and as well few in number so as to reduce chances of the user leaving the test halfway due to the increasing number of questions.

This application would be recommended to be introduced to candidate classes so that they can select their career choices wisely based on their temperament before transitioning to insititutions of higher learning.


## Behaviour Driven Development


BDD focuses on how the user will navigate the KnowYourTrait application from the landing page all the way to taking the test and recieving results.

The development team expects the user to:

1. Visit the KnowYourTrait website
2. Navigate through the about section to get further details of the test they are taking or    
   just go straight to clicking the **Go To Test** button.
3. Attempt all the quiz questions.
4. Upon completion, the application should then display the user's personality trait, a brief 
   description of a person in that personality bracket and lastly examples of the career that can opted for.
